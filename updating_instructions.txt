ADDING POKEMON
    fill the pkmn_data/data.csv with new pokemon data
    open CMD inside the pkmn_data folder and run 'python insert_csv.py' (this script will ask you to press enter before it does anything)
    add stuff to  (the files inside pkmn_data)  misspellings, sprite_cycles, namings or suffix_namings if there is any, but make sure the jsons are valid (either open them in VS Code or use some json validator)
ADDING SPRITES
    after adding new sprite images into all folders, just run 'python encoder.py' (it's also inside the pkmn_data folder)
    (no need for moving any encoded image files, the encoder.py already does it)
ADDING NEW BOXES
    edit the box variables at the beginning of front.json
    open CMD in the root folder and do 'npm run build' (this is only required if adding boxes, not needed for other changes)

ENABLE MAINTENANCE
	open the maintenance.json in the root folder and set it to true
